# Billing Automation Pipeline 🐍💸

Real-world project I built to eliminate manual billing for 100+ successful trips per week at my part-time job.

**Before**: 4–6 hours/week of copy-paste hell in Excel  
**After**: < 5 minutes + fully automated invoices & reports

### Current Features
- Pull & filter successful trips from CSV/database
- Calculate charges automatically
- Generate beautiful PDF invoices (ReportLab)
- FastAPI endpoints ready for webhooks & integrations
- Scheduled daily runs (APScheduler)

### Tech stack
FastAPI • Python • Pandas • ReportLab • Stripe (coming) • Docker • Render/Railway

Live demo → "Under Construction"

Still adding Stripe webhooks and email notifications this week — follow along!

Open to full-time remote or high-impact contract roles in backend / fintech / automation.
Currently fixing and updating my database for this project in this week.
